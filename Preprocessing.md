# Pre-Processing

In this section of the guide, we outline pre-processing of data that
is part of human single-neuron projects.

As well as the below mentioned tool, pre-process in the
HSNPipeline requires the
[hsntools](https://hsnpipeline.github.io/hsntools/) module.

### neo

To access recorded single-neuron data, we need to load and access data which may come in various
different file formats depending on the system and amplifier used.

As a general purpose tool to load variable different neuroscience data formats,
this HSNPipeline uses the [neo](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/python-neo)
Python module.


## Data Reading

this template does not include IO functions for raw data files,
and custom IO procedures may need to be updated / added.


## PrepTEMPLATE

The [PrepTEMPLATE](https://github.com/HSNPipeline/PrepTEMPLATE) provides a
template structure for managing pre-processing of HSN data.
